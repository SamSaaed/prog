        <h3 >Definiation Of Programming</h3>
        <p>
            What is programming?
There are countless definitions of what computer programming is, but here is mine.
“Programming is how you get computers to solve problems.”
There are two key phrases here that are important:

    You: without the programmer (you), the computer is useless. It does what you tell it to do.
    Solve problems: computers are tools. They are complex tools, admittedly, but they are not mysterious or magical: they exist to make tasks easier.

        <h3 >common Programming languages</h3>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, computers don’t understand languages like English or Spanish, so we have to use a programming language they understand to give them instructions.
 
There are many different programming languages, all of which have their own merits, and certain languages are better suited to particular types of tasks, but there is no one language that is the ‘best’.
